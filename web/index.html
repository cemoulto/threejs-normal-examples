<p>Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</p>

Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up. I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.</p>
